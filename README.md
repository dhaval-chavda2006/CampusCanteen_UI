CampusCanteen – Food Ordering UI
Welcome to CampusCanteen, a user-friendly and visually appealing front-end project that simulates an online food ordering experience for college canteens. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with features like live search, dark/light theme toggle, category filtering, and a working cart.

#Features
 Personalized greeting using local storage
 Real-time search functionality
 Category tabs (Snacks, Drinks, Meals, All)
 Dynamic cart with item quantity and total
 Light/Dark mode toggle with memory
 Place Order button to simulate checkout
 My Orders page to view past orders with status simulation

#Technologies Used
HTML5 for structure
CSS3 for responsive styling
JavaScript for functionality
LocalStorage to preserve user and theme preferences

? Why I Built This
I wanted to build a practical, UI-driven application to simulate real-world ordering systems. It was a great way to practice DOM manipulation, user interaction, and local storage in JavaScript.
